# Linear-Regression-Implementation-on-Height-Weight-Dataset

This project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict the height of individuals based on certain predictor variables. The dataset used contains information about the predictor variables and corresponding heights of individuals. The goal is to build a reliable model that accurately predicts height using the provided data.
